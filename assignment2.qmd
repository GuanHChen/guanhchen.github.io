library(tidyverse)
TEDS_2016 <-
  read_stata("/Users/guan/Documents/Knowledge Mining /Assignment 2 Knowledge Mining/TEDS_2016.dta")

ggplot(data = TEDS_2016) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = age, y = income))
```

At first glance, it is difficult to identify trends because a lot of the variables are binary (i.e. sex, party, whitecollar). 

Missing values can be handled by omitting the NA values.
