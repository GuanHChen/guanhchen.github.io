    "text": "Inge Druckrey: Teaching to See\nThe video explores a unique artistic paradigm: defining objects by their visual features rather than their function. For instance, a banana is perceived not as food, but as a curve with contours that convey information like the thickness of its peel. This method of breaking down objects into their visual components is a fundamental principle for an artist, enabling them to observe the world as it truly is constructed, not as they have been conditioned to see it.\nThe documentary further characterizes the roles of the eye and the hand as opposing forces in the history of writing. The eye is portrayed as a conservative force that seeks order and perfection in letterforms. Conversely, the hand is a radical force, driven by a desire for speed and expression. This inherent conflict between the eye’s pursuit of a consistent, perfect pattern and the hand’s natural haste shapes the evolution of typography and calligraphy.\nDrawing on his experience in calligraphy, Steve Jobs insisted that the Mac be the first personal computer to feature multiple typefaces and proportionally spaced fonts. Jobs believed that the aesthetic quality of typography added an intangible benefit to the user experience, an idea that proved revolutionary and was later adopted as an industry standard. This focus on aesthetic detail over simple utility exemplifies the same “artist’s eye” that deconstructs a banana into its visual features rather than its function.\nOur perception of visual weight in typography often differs from its geometric reality. While a letter may be precisely 20 pixels wide, its visual weight can appear off-balance. For example, a geometrically accurate letter like an “O” might look too thin compared to a “T” if its stroke weight is not optically adjusted. Therefore, good font design requires an artist’s eye to balance optical perception, rather than relying solely on geometric accuracy. This subtle manipulation of visual features ensures that the typography looks balanced and harmonious to the human eye, even if the underlying measurements are not uniform."

    "text": "Whispering with excitement to my friend, I exclaimed, “Watch this.”\n\ninstall.packages('dplyr')\n\nMy index finger slammed onto the enter key, as if attempting to drive it through the keyboard. An irresistible grin spread across my face as the glorious stream of text flowed through the console, allowing me to manifest my inner ‘hackerman,’ culminating in the satisfying message:\n\ndownloaded 1.5 MB\n\nTurning to my friend, who had been tutoring me, I observed what I would like to consider stone-faced awe. Truth be told, entering the Social Data Analytics and Research (SDAR) master’s program with a background in biochemistry has proven to be a challenging yet rewarding transition. While I had become comfortable physically generating data and performing statistical analysis in the Palmer lab, handling these tasks virtually and exclusively through code posed a different, yet gratifying challenge.\nIn just three months into the program, I’ve already identified parallels between my data science coursework and my professional experience as a scientist. My presentation skills from participating in the Summer Platform for Undergraduate Research (SPUR) translated seamlessly, highlighting my aptitude for explaining complex work in simple terms and defending project intricacies under scrutiny. Additionally, leading the PFAS team in the Palmer lab has equipped me with invaluable experience in managing social and logistical complexities within a team setting. My skill set has prepared me to excel in my classes and collaborate effectively with my peers.\nDespite being a novice in coding, my rapid progress is evident in the creation of my personal website. I find myself improving the site as I update it with new assignments. This platform showcases my achievements and serves as a testament to my coding proficiency and continuous improvement.\nUltimately, my aim is to cultivate my skills as a data scientist at the University of Texas at Dallas and to leverage my biochemistry background to make meaningful contributions to the medical industry. I hope to utilize the scholarship funds to invest in my education, paving the way for a future where my coding prowess can measurably impact people’s lives. I aspire to be a true ‘hackerman’ and to a future where the power of my enter key can make a tangible and positive difference in the world."
