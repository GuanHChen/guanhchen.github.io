#### 1. An E-R diagram can be viewed as a graph. What do the following mean in terms of the structure of an enterprise schema?
##### a) The graph is disconnected.

A disconnected graph indicates that an entity does not have a direct relationship with other entities. For example, there could be an audit table that tracks modifications to other tables.

##### b) The graph has a cycle.

A cycle is indicative of a recursive relationship or dependencies between entities. 

#### 2. Construct an E-R diagram for a hospital with a set of patients and a set of medical doctors. Associate with each patient a log of the various tests and examinations conducted

#### 3. We can convert any weak entity set to a strong entity set by simply adding appropriate attributes. Why, then, do we have weak entity sets?

Relationships can be complex or hierarchical. There may be some factor that makes modeling relationships with purely attributes difficult. Having weak entities may make modeling certain relationships easier. 

#### 4. 
##### a)
##### i.

SELECT e.ID, e.person_name

FROM employee e

JOIN works w ON w.ID = e.ID

JOIN company c ON w.company_name = c.company_name

WHERE e.city = c.city

##### ii.

SELECT e.ID, e.person_name

FROM employee e

JOIN manages m ON m.ID = e.ID

WHERE e.city = (SELECT e.city FROM employee e WHERE e.ID = m.ID)

##### iii.

SELECT e.ID, e.person_name

FROM employee e

JOIN works w ON w.ID = e.ID

JOIN company c on c.company_name = w.company_name

WHERE w.salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM works WHERE company_name = c.company_name)

##### b)

The query does not account for multiple sections. Therefore, courses taught in the Spring of 2017 appear multiple times if they have mor ethan one section. This can be fixed by using the DISTINCT keyword.
